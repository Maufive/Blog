__Getting stuff done__

_I made this post as a todo-list for myself..._

Fix the searchbar in the navsystem. Should be included in the collapsed searchbar
aswell. Minimalistic style. Also gonna be looking into github pages. Google the course on Treehouse as it's currently not available on their site.

Maybe the textfield in every blogpost is too wide. Maybe look at some different fonts. I also need to get a real avatar. Going to be doodling some sketches. __Atleast__ change from the current one before hosting it on pages. Lastly, I need to get more used to Github in general, get more comfortable with git.
