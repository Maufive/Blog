Hi there! This is my first entry in my blog and it wont be a long one.
This is more like a note to myself to make a proper entry later
describing basically where I'm at right now. Spent the latest couple of
days trying to get a grip on Jekyll. Found a theme that I liked and I'm gonna spend the next couple of days styling it in my own way. Going to be making a couple of hover effects on the share links. Invert the color on hover, both icon and background.


Adding more color for mobile browsers. Maybe make some more interesting buttons and tag/categories icons. Adding the icons in the navbar aswell.

Peace out homies!
